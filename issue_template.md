2. As a user, I want to register with my name, username, age, and country so that I can create an account and access the habit tracking features.
3. [Account login]
4. As a user, I want to log in using my username and password so that I can access my account and track my habits.
5. [Error feedback on login]
6. As a user, I want to receive a message if I enter the wrong username or password so that I know my login attempt was unsuccessful.

**Story Points:** [Estimated Effort in Points]
**Notes:**
- [Additional information or edge cases]
- Note: The user is able to register; however, due to security constraints, the credentials are not saved in the browser cache but are removed once the user logs out. Therefore, the user is unable to log in with their own credentials. The only way to log in is with the default username and password.
